I am contacting you concerning a customer who placed an investment\nunder our bank many years ago.\nFirstly, I discreetly request that you keep the contents of this mail\nconfidential. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I\nbelieve would be of interest to you. In 2004, a customer established a\nportfolio of $11,600,000. (Eleven million, six hundred thousand United\nStates Dollars). This money was determined to be turned over in investment\nand at that time I was the account officer to this client.\n As at 2006, the client requested for liquidation due to urgent investments\nin Europe. I have waited to hear back from him as to what he wants me to do\nas his personal accountant but got no response from him after several\nmessages via email which was our means of communication except for times\nwhen he comes to the bank in person or we call him directly.\nI made futile efforts to locate him hand in hand with the internal\ninvestigations department of the bank. Information was gathered which\nshowed that apparently he was dead. A person who suited his description was\ndeclared dead of a heart attack in Richards Bay, South Africa. The bank\nimmediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin\nto alert them about the situation and also to come forward to claim his\nestate. The investigation has come to an end.\nIn his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private\nbanking, opening an account with us means no one will know of its\nexistence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers\nand codes to make the accounts anonymous.\nThis bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to\nthem or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the\naccount and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin.\nYou should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what\nI propose. I alone have the deposit details and they will release the\ndeposit to no one unless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the\nexistence of this deposit for as far as this is concerned, the transaction\nwith our deceased customer concluded when I sent the funds to the firm, all\noutstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services\nand due process. They are simply awaiting instructions to release the\ndeposit to any party that comes forward. This is the situation.\nI am prepared to place you in a position to give instruction for the\nrelease of the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon\nreceipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you 60/40\npercent. That is I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have\nthem release the deposit to you.\nI will inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the\ncustomer and then officially communicate with the firm and instruct them to\nrelease the deposit to you. The alternative would be for us to have the\nfirm direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder. This way\nthere will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from the\nfirm. We can fine-tune this, based on our interactions. I am aware of the\nconsequences of this proposal.\nI have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you\ndeclining to work with me and alerting my bank. I ask that if you find no\ninterest in this project that you should disregard and discard this mail,\notherwise contact me through this same email account. I will provide you\nwith my phone number in order that we discuss.\nI await your positive response.\nBrandon Mla\n"], "outbound_messages": ["From: wi85126@m**************p\nTo: h***********3@gmail.com\nTime: 2022-07-12 17:16:40\nSUBJECT: Re: re\nI am a bit busy now, but I am definitely interesting about what you said.
