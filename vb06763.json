Bear in mind that situations\nhere in Hong Kong has escalated becoming more violent and protesters are\nbeing called terrorist by China. All Hong Kongers especially those with\nforeign links are closely monitored and sometimes are being held at the\nBorder by China. Hence, I would like to be sure of your willingness,\ntrustworthiness and commitment to execute this transaction with me, I\ncannot afford to compromise these virtues for our sake because this\ntransaction is highly sensitive, I have my principles which will profit the\nboth of us. I will need you to follow my instruction to enable us have this\ntransaction completed on time.\nI know you might be wondering where I got your email contact but to be\nhonest with you, I got your contact email discretely on the internet during\nmy search for a reliable partner who have same last name as my deceased\nclient and be of assistance to me in order to have the funds transferred\nout, if you read my previous emails properly I have explained why I need\nyour assistance, I did consider what you might think about my kind of\nperson but when you know that the safety of your kids are threatened and\ntheir lives are in danger you will act just like me as a mother which is to\nprotect your loved ones.\nThe fact remains that I cannot transfer the funds in my own name, this is\nthe main reason your assistance as a foreigner is required. I would have\ngone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have drawn a\nstraight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit, but on the\nother hand, you as an indifferent foreigner would easily pass as the\nbeneficiary with the rights to claim. I assure you that I could have the\ndeposit released to you in a few days. I will simply inform our bank of the\nfinal closing of the file relating to the customer, I will then officially\ncommunicate with the finance company and instruct them to release the\ndeposit to you; with these two things: all is done. The best would be for\nus to have the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account\nholder but the bank must have same telex-type with our bank here in Hong\nKong, this way your protection is sealed too. We can fine-tune this based\non our interactions.\nConsidering the money involved, it is necessary for me to be sure of the\nperson to whom I will be entrusting this transaction, my trust is not given\nout lightly and I do not expect you to trust me that easy too, so I need to\nbe convinced that you are a matured person with some integrity and I will\nalso prove my integrity to you.

Every documents will be done to meet all international\nbeneficiary claim standards and I will be responsible for his payment so\ndon't think about that.\nI must also inform you that you will not have to travel to anywhere for any\nreason, because the attorney shall be handling all matters of probate on\nyour behalf, you will be duly represented here by the attorney, he is an\naccredited lawyer with vast experience in issues of inheritance here in\nHong Kong. He will have all the documents perfected, and with these\ndocuments he shall come forward to apply for the immediate release and\ntransfer of the funds to you.\nWhat I expect from you is trust and commitment, I want this large sum of\nmoney transferred with your assistance, and as a banker for many years I\nknow that if we follow up this transaction diligently it would be completed\nas soon as possible without any question.\nI want to know if you are willing to follow up this business seriously\nbefore I can give you more details about this transaction, as a result of\nwhich I shall be waiting for your response and assurance, you need to be\nsomeone whom I can rely upon, at least for absolute commitment.\nRegard\nMrs.Dora Bao Xin Yan\n", "From: m***************1@gmail.com\nTo: vb06763@m**************p\nTime: 2022-07-24 14:47:36\nSUBJECT: RE\nHello Dear hope you are doing well and your family as well\nI have been wondering i haven't heard from you since a while now\nPlease get back to me so we can get this transaction out in a few days.\nBut you are not showing your commitment and i will also want you to know\nthat am still waiting for you because i know deep in my heart you are the\nright partner for this transaction\nand also remember that this transaction is highly capital intensive which\ncan change both live's\nPlease i want your assistance in achieving this transaction\nI await to hear from you soon your sister\nMrs Dora Bao Xin Yan.\n", "From: m***************1@gmail.com\nTo: vb06763@m**************p\nTime: 2022-07-25 11:13:16\nSUBJECT: Re: RE\nDear Partner\nThank you for your message, I just want to confirm your readiness to help\nme and to also keep this discreet to protect us both.

Bear in mind that situations\nhere in Hong Kong has escalated becoming more violent and protesters are\nbeing called terrorist by China. All Hong Kongers especially those with\nforeign links are closely monitored and sometimes are being held at the\nBorder by China. Hence, I would like to be sure of your willingness,\ntrustworthiness and commitment to execute this transaction with me, I\ncannot afford to compromise these virtues for our sake because this\ntransaction is highly sensitive, I have my principles which will profit the\nboth of us. I will need you to follow my instruction to enable us have this\ntransaction completed on time.\nI know you might be wondering where I got your email contact but to be\nhonest with you, I got your contact email discretely on the internet during\nmy search for a reliable partner who have same last name as my deceased\nclient and be of assistance to me in order to have the funds transferred\nout, if you read my previous emails properly I have explained why I need\nyour assistance, I did consider what you might think about my kind of\nperson but when you know that the safety of your kids are threatened and\ntheir lives are in danger you will act just like me as a mother which is to\nprotect your loved ones.\nThe fact remains that I cannot transfer the funds in my own name, this is\nthe main reason your assistance as a foreigner is required. I would have\ngone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have drawn a\nstraight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit, but on the\nother hand, you as an indifferent foreigner would easily pass as the\nbeneficiary with the rights to claim. I assure you that I could have the\ndeposit released to you in a few days. I will simply inform our bank of the\nfinal closing of the file relating to the customer, I will then officially\ncommunicate with the finance company and instruct them to release the\ndeposit to you; with these two things: all is done. The best would be for\nus to have the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account\nholder but the bank must have same telex-type with our bank here in Hong\nKong, this way your protection is sealed too. We can fine-tune this based\non our interactions.\nConsidering the money involved, it is necessary for me to be sure of the\nperson to whom I will be entrusting this transaction, my trust is not given\nout lightly and I do not expect you to trust me that easy too, so I need to\nbe convinced that you are a matured person with some integrity and I will\nalso prove my integrity to you. With regards to the legality of this\ntransaction, I want to inform you that the attorney I am using will prepare\nthe affidavits which shall legally put you in place as beneficiary; and\nwill obtain the necessary clearances which will cover all the aspects\ninvolved in this transaction from the Hong Kong authorities including the\nJustice department. Every documents will be done to meet all international\nbeneficiary claim standards and I will be responsible for his payment so\ndon't think about that.\nI must also inform you that you will not have to travel to anywhere for any\nreason, because the attorney shall be handling all matters of probate on\nyour behalf, you will be duly represented here by the attorney, he is an\naccredited lawyer with vast experience in issues of inheritance here in\nHong Kong. He will have all the documents perfected, and with these\ndocuments he shall come forward to apply for the immediate release and\ntransfer of the funds to you.\nWhat I expect from you is trust and commitment, I want this large sum of\nmoney transferred with your assistance, and as a banker for many years I\nknow that if we follow up this transaction diligently it would be completed\nas soon as possible without any question.\nI want to know if you are willing to follow up this business seriously\nbefore I can give you more details about this transaction, as a result of\nwhich I shall be waiting for your response and assurance, you need to be\nsomeone whom I can rely upon, at least for absolute commitment.\nRegard\nMrs.Dora Bao Xin Yan\n", "direction": "Inbound"}, {"time": "1658486409", "subject": "SUBJECT: Re:", "body": "That sounds like a great chance for both of us.
