I have worked as the Assistant to the Director\nand was demoted when they found out that I have never been in support\nof their shady deals, they wrote petition against me and I was moved\nto the Finance Ministry but now I am back to continue my good work\nwhich I believe in transparency to humanity.\nThough I am now in a lower department and position, I still have\naccess to transfer files .I have gone through your file and have found\nthat you have completed all that is required of you to have your fund\nreleased into your account but the greed which exist in the lives of\nthe Directors of the Foreign Payment, PT. Bank HSBC Indonesia, and\nother approved paying Banks here will not let them do what they are\nsupposed to do. I am happy for the good President we have in Indonesia\ntoday who is not like the former presidents who did nothing about\ncorruption/corrupt practices in the payment system.\nBecause of their greed and amount involved, they would not let you\nknow what to do to get your funds transferred.The money you have spent\nin the past is nothing compared to what they make from your funds\nthrough what we call International Trade on Stock and Exchange. This\nwas what Prof. Lee, Vincent Wing Sing and the HSBC introduced to all\nof them, telling them never to release your already approved payment\nso that they can use it to trade on the International Market on 60\ndays intervals and make 10% of the amount. Check out how much they\nmust have made with your payment since it was first approved for\ntransfer.\nThis is one secret most of our foreign beneficiaries are not aware of\nand they need someone to stand for them to clear this and make them\nget their payments within 48 hours. To be frank with you, if I had\ncontacted you earlier, you would have received this money in your\naccount directly today through KTT wire transfer because I know their\nsecret which they believe no one else is aware of or will be\nintimidated to speak up.\nI will tell you what you have to do as soon as I get your response to\nhave your fund transferred with 48 hours. This is what I was doing for\nsome beneficiaries and the Directors suspected and kicked against me.\nI have no interest in your money, I have no interest in what they do\ntoo but my anger is that they use and dump us not because we want to\nshare money with them but because they think we know nothing about\ntheir deals. Please assure me that no one will know about this and it\nwill be secret until you have received the document and take them by\nsurprise.
