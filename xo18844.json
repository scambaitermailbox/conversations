I appreciate the fact that we are\nstrangers for now but knowing that all relationship starts from\nstrangers to friendship and family in a moment of trust and sincerity\nso please note that trust is very essential in all dealings. My name\nis Sgt. Joyce Scranton, an American soldier serving in the US military\nin Camp Stanley Damascus Syria.  Camp Stanley is one of the military\nbases run by the United States of America in Syria. It is located\nclose to Damascus and is considered to be the largest part of the Red\nCloud Garrison. It is located relatively close to the DMZ ( Damascus\nsyria Zone) and aims to ensure the peace in the area. The history of\nthis military base is not very rich, although old enough. I must thank\nyou for your response once again as this shows your interest and I\nappreciate that.\nIn the past years there has been severe Wars/rainfall that caused\ndeadly flooding and damage to Syria. Some wealthy people including\npoliticians were killed and their houses and companies were destroyed\nas a result of the severe floods/War. Majority of them lost their\nentire family as a result of this and a great sum of United States\ncurrencies were realized by the Government in their business\nstructures, that is houses that were destroyed but mostly companies.\nDuring a routine patrol by my unit sometime ago, some of us discovered\na huge safe buried in a destroyed building. Most of the soldiers in my\nunit were not aware of this as we kept it secret till we had time to\npersonally inspect the safe and found out it contained the sum of  $35\nMillion. This politicians understood the laws against such amount of\ncurrency in the country so I believed they buried it and secretly used\nit for their political mischief. Three of us who found it decided to\nsplit it amongst ourselves and at the moment, I have my share of $10\nMillion privately secured and safe in two trunk boxes without the\nawareness of anyone but I cannot continue to hold it back here for\nlong because of my active duty.\nI am thinking of sending this boxes through courier service company In\norder to ship the package which contains the money. The package will\nbe tagged diplomatic documents and ancient graphic art material so\nthat the Courier Delivery Agent will not know the contents of the\nboxes. I have decided to send it through courier service as I do not\nwant this going through banks around here since it will not be safe\nfor us.\nI am so sorry to encroach into your privacy in this manner but I got\nyour email address from an address journal and I found it pleasurable\nto contact you On the Web for help. I am looking for a trust worthy\nperson I can entrust this funds to until I get back from my station in\nDamascus syria.\nMy late husband (Jonathan Scranton) would have taken responsibility of\nthis package but I lost him to Fort Hood shooting in 2017. I feel so\nbad when I remember his death. His painful death made me to join the\nUS Army. It is so painful to remember that I lost him on that faithful\nday. Right now I am determined to fight terrorism with all my\nstrenght. I want to have a very peaceful retirement, maybe get married\nagain.\nI am sure you will know the best way to handle such an amount of money\nfor us when it gets to you. I only need your trust, I will start\nmaking arrangements to ship them at once. If we are lucky and fast\nenough, we can conclude this within the next few days.\nI will send the whole amount since I cannot keep any on me but can I\ntrust you? As I already informed you that this is of mutual benefit so\nonce it gets to you, you are to take 30 percent of the total sum for\nyourself, keep 60 percent for me and donate the remaining 10 percent\nto any charity organization so that our good Lord will assist and\nbless us in future.  I believe this is fair enough.\nPlease I would like to know a little bit more about you like what you\ndo for a living, if you are married and so on because it is important\nthat I know in totality the personality upon whom I transact this deal\nwith. You should understand my fears here as this involves a large sum\nof cash.  We need to build trust.\nI want you to know that the knowledge of this money leaving the\nprovince of Damascus to any safe location is just between the two of\nus so please endeavor to keep it this way. If you are not capable of\nhandling this huge sum then please do not allow me ship them to you.\nWe must keep a low profile as a result of the amount in question and\nplease do not let me down.\nKeep in mind at all time the need for confidentiality and absolute\nsecrecy until we conclude this deal. Phone conversation is not a safe\nmeasure in this endeavor besides I cannot call you on the phone or\nreceive fax for I am not always at base as a result of my operational\nschedule and active duty. Hope you are okay with this? Everything must\nbe done by email so I will like to know if you are still willing to\nhelp as I need your urgent reply to this regard.\nI cannot be seen with any sum above 100 USD around here, as it is not\nallowed or make transfers on this course (it will be a serious risk on\nmy side and bring about awareness on our monitoring team).\nCONFIDENTIALITY\nNote that the courier service Delivery will not be aware of the\ncontent of the boxes so please do not tell him that they contain\nmoney. The boxes are packaged in a consignment as art works and\nartifacts.Just let him know they belongs to a dead soldier who is\nrelated to you.  I shall send you the pictures of myself and the\nconsignment boxes.\nCan you handle this? Get back to me ASAP If you're interested in doing\nthis for me, so I can let you know how it will work.\nGod bless you and God bless America.
