My name is Gary Lee\nBlake,Special Agent, Office for Victims of Crime, U.S. Dept. of\nJustice. We are delegated from the Fraud Section of the Criminal\nDivision and the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, to reimburse\nand/or recompense individuals or entities who have been victims of one\nform of Internet\nfraud or the other.\nMore than 6000 fraud criminals in the USA, Australia, North and South\nAmerica, Europe, and Africa have been arrested as part of \u201cOperation\nGlobal Con\u201d \u2013 the largest and most far-reaching multinational\nenforcement operation ever directed at mass-marketing fraud schemes.\nThe ongoing action began on March 1, 2005, till date, and involved\nunprecedented coordination by law enforcement agencies at the national\nand international levels. \u201cOperation Global Con\u201d targeted\nmass-marketing fraud schemes that were international in scope and\nimpact, were conducted by criminal groups, and generated significant\nproceeds. The schemes were carried out through various methods, such\nas telephone, the Internet, and mass mailings. The wide variety of\nschemes uncovered during the operation included so-called \u201c419\"\nadvance-fee schemes; foreign currency trading; bogus lottery,\nprize,and sweepstakes schemes; offers of nonexistent investments;bogus\noffers of \u201cpre-approved\u201d credit cards or credit-card\nprotection;next-of-kin inheritance; dating, and tax fraud schemes.\nThe 96 separate U.S. investigations in this operation led to the\ndiscovery of more than 5.8 million victims, who suffered losses\ntotaling more than $8 billion.\nThe operation resulted in the arrest of 737 individuals in the United\nStates, and an additional 22063 arrests in Canada, Germany, the UK,\nthe Netherlands, Brazil, Turkey Africa, and Spain. Authorities\nexecuted 9047 search warrants in the five countries and continents as\npart of the operation, and over 3000 individuals have been convicted\nglobally to date. In addition, the Law Enforcement Agencies brought 20\ncivil actions against 1400 defendants in illegal fraud schemes. In\nterms of economic crime and fraud, this is one of the biggest\noperations there has ever been. The kind of co-operation we\u2019ve seen\nhas never been seen before in terms of going after international\nfraudsters.\nWe are writing you because of the confessional statements available to\nus; some of the criminals arrested in the multinational enforcement\noperation are indicted for defrauding you and many other individuals\nunder falsified names and/or identities.\nThe success of Operation Global Con will not be complete without many\nfraud victims, getting their money back (or at least some of it). This\nis really important to us. Thus, it was decided to set up a\n\u201ccontingent reimbursement model\u201d to be undertaken by the Justice\nDepartment. This would set out the circumstances under which people\nwould get their money back. Whether compensation would be paid would\ndepend on whether the individual/organization had met required\nstandards, such as providing concrete evidence of the monies they lost\nto the fraudsters. Therefore, you should collect all the information\nyou have about the scam and send it to us in support of your\ncompensation benefit:-\n1. Correspondence with fraudsters (e. G. Letters, e-mails, text messages)\n2. Contact information that the fraudster(s) have used to contact you\n(e.g. phone numbers, e-mail addresses).\n3. Websites and social media accounts used for fraud (if\navailable,print copies and send them to us By e-mail attachment .\n4. Any papers, documents, or identification documents used for fraud\nby the fraud criminals (print Copies and send them to us by\n  e-mail attachment or fax).\nIn addition, you should provide us with a scanned copy of acceptable\nidentity cards, such as an employment letter, driver's license,\nnational ID, or international passport. It is important that you\nprovide this information because they are needed to help us determine\nwhether you are eligible for this compensation and how much you should\nget as reimbursement if you are eligible.\nWe will normally give you one week to send in everything we need. We\nmay be able to give you longer if there is a good reason why you can\u2019t\ngive us the information in that time. If your claim is successfully\ninvestigated by the Department it will be referred to a designated\nbank which will then transfer the fixed reimbursement to your bank\naccount.\nThank you,\nGary L.
