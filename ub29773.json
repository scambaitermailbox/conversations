The late depositor lived and worked in the Philippines and he\ndeposited in our bank the sum of sixteen million, four thousand US dollars\n(US$16,004,000.00) as fixed deposit in early 2005. However, there is a new\nfinancial law in our country that prohibits foreigners without a Labor\nPermit (Work Permit) to open a new bank account or operate an existing bank\naccount. In regard to this new law, we have advised all our foreign\ncustomers who opened their bank account without a labor permit to either\nbring their labor permit to have their bank account updated or have their\ndeposits withdrawn from our bank. Failure to update such a bank account\nwith a labor permit will mean losing the deposit to the government of our\ncountry if the deposit is not withdrawn.\nAs the operations manager, I have tried several times to alert this\nparticular depositor on the new law and why his bank account must be\nimmediately updated with a labor permit or have his deposit withdrawn but\nhe could not be reached. The deposit will soon be taken over by the\ngovernment since I could not contact him and he did not leave any other\nperson in the form of a next of kin/beneficiary who I can contact in a case\nlike this. The fear of having the deposit lost to the government of our\ncountry prompted me to make inquiries to know his whereabouts and I\nrealized that he died in late 2007 as a result of heart related illness.\nSince I have been unsuccessful in locating any of his relatives, I seek\nyour consent to present you to our bank as the legal beneficiary to enable\nyou to claim the money he left in our bank.\nBoth of us will share the money into two equal parts when the money is\nclaimed. Everything will be done successfully as I am in a position to\ninfluence things in our favor, have no fear about this transaction because\nit will be perfectly and successfully done. Right now, I have all the\ncopies of documents relating to the deposit and the depositor which you\nwill file to back up your claim as the legal beneficiary. All I require is\nyour honest cooperation to enable us to claim the deposit successfully and\nwe have to do this within the shortest time possible in order to avert its\nforfeiture. If you are willing to do this with me, you are to provide me\nwith the below details:\nFull Names:\nResidential/Official Address (Not P. O.
