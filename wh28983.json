My name is Mrs. Catherine Afred, I am 65 years old and I\nam married to Mr. Williams Afred, and we were married for a period of (20)\ntwenty years before he died in 2019.\nWe were married for 20 years without a child and he died after a\nbrief illness and since his death I decided not to remarry due to\nmy religious belief and old age. When my late husband was alive\nhe deposited the sum of three million five hundred thousand Euros\n(3.5 Million Euros) with a Bank here. Presently this money is still in\nthe custody of the Bank. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not\nlast for the next four months due to my cancer illness.\nHaving known my condition I decided to donate this money to\nchurches, organizations or good people that will utilize this fund the way\nI am going to instruct for a proper idea on how this fund would be used.\nI want you to use this money for charity organizations, orphanages, widows\nand other people that are in need. I took this decision because I don\u2019t\nhave any child that will inherit this money. Moreover, my husband\u2019s\nrelatives are not close to me since I developed cancer illness and it had\nbeen their wish to see me dead so as to enable them to inherit my husband\u2019s\nwealth hence we have no Child. These people are not worthy of this\ninheritance. This is why I am taking this decision to contact you and\ndonate this fund to you for the charity works. And 30% of this money will\nbe for your time and effort, while 70% goes to charities.\nAs soon as I receive your reply, I will give you the contact of the Bank\nwhere this fund was deposited by my deceased husband before his sudden\ndeath.\nAny delay in your reply may give me room to look for another good person\nfor this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I\nstated above.\nThanks and Remain blessed.\nYours Sister\nMrs. Catherine Afred\n", "From: c**************0@gmail.com\nTo: wh28983@m**************p\nTime: 2022-07-13 17:31:27\nSUBJECT: Your sister in Christ Mrs. Catherine Afred\nDear in Christ,\nThanks for your kind mail and your pity concerning my situation.
