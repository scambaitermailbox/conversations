Nevertheless, I have contacted you with genuine intentions, and I hope I can trust you with this opportunity which I explain below.\nMy name is Brian Gilvary, \nan account manager with a bank here in United Kingdom\n. I retrieved your contact address in my search for the next of kin to a deceased customer of our bank (Name withheld for security reasons), because this is the first memo to you. This customer died from Cardiac Arrest in 2012. Unfortunately, this customer died intestate, leaving his bank account with an open beneficiary status. All efforts made by our bank to locate his relatives have been unsuccessful, so I decided to write you.  I have monitored this account in the bank for almost ten years now and no one has come forth with any claim. I want to present you to our bank as his next of kin to claim this dormant account worth BPS37.7 Million (Thirty Seven Million Seven, Hundred Thousand British Pound Stering).\nYou will apply to the bank as an extended relative to the deceased customer while I work from the inside to ensure all needed information and evidence is provided to you to back up your claim. The account has an open beneficiary status, which is why I have contacted you to come forth and claim the funds as the next of kin and beneficiary. Since he is from your country, it is easy for you to become his official next of kin. If we do not claim the funds now, the funds would be reverted to the system as the unclaimed estate at the expiration of a 10-year dormancy period.\nI assure you that this transaction will be handled under due inheritance procedures, and every necessary legitimate arrangement will be put in place to make you the real beneficiary of the inheritance funds. It also requires all confidentiality at this stage, and I believe you are ready to keep this discreet until you can claim the funds from the bank. Once the funds are released to you, they will be shared between the two of us.\nPlease send your response indicating readiness to proceed with this transaction. Then I will give you more details, and we shall have an in-depth discussion regarding the successful completion of this transaction.\nI await your response.\nBest regards.\nBrian.\n", "From: g*******0@aol.com\nTo: hc72725@m**************p\nTime: 2022-07-30 14:47:34\nSUBJECT: DETAILS\nMy Dear\u00a0Thank you very much\u00a0 for your keen interest to work with me\u00a0 to accomplish this noble venture but\u00a0 I need your trust and honesty in this regardsHowever I must assure you that this transaction is already successful if you can be trusted.\nActually\u00a0 , I am a man of\u00a0 integrity and dignity,\u00a0 so as such I\u00a0 would\u00a0 entirely\u00a0 disentangle myself from any convicting act that will\u00a0 endanger my reputation.\u00a0 so if you have\u00a0 actually\u00a0 \u00a0made up your mind towards the accomplishment of\u00a0 this noble project , then we can work together as a partner .' it might interest you to know that there is no potencial risk attached.Meanwhile confirm the following information so that we can\u00a0 proceed\u00a0 from there.Full name\u2026Tel:..................Address:\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Age:\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.Occupation:\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.Marital status:\u2026\u2026\u2026.Any form of your ID\u2026\u2026\u2026..\nCountry of origin:\u2026\u2026\u2026..Sequel upon\u00a0 the receipt of your information which i requested from you, I will detail you on the way forward.Meanwhile, i will appreciate your maximum cooperation, truss and honesty in this noble venture and I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.However, I worked with the National Westminster Bank here in the UK as the director of\u00a0 banking operation.Actually, my main aim of contacting you is to make you act as the next of kin to the deceased funds \u00a337.7 million pound sterling in the custody of our bank.Please I need your maximum cooperation.Meanwhile, I do not want the bank to know that I am actively involved in this deal but\u00a0 I remain an active insider who will approve all the procured documents\u00a0 involved in this transactions.Below is the contact of the bank accredited attorney who will assist you procure the necessary documents for claims of the deceased funds in the custody of our bank?
