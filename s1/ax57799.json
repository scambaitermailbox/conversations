I retrieved your contact address in my\nsearch for the next of kin to a deceased customer of our bank Mr Larry Hyde\n a citizen of USA, who lived and died in London from Cardiac Arrest in the\nyear 2013.  Unfortunately this customer died intestate leaving his bank\naccount with an open beneficiary status.All efforts made by our bank to\nlocate his relatives have been unsuccessful so I decided to write you as I\nhave monitored this account in the bank for almost 10 years now and no one\nhas come forth with any claim. I would like to present you to our bank as\nhis next of kin  so as to claim this dormant account worth $19.7Mllion USD\n(Nineteen Million Seven Hundred Thousand US Dollars).You will apply to the\nbank as an extended relative to the deceased customer while I work from the\ninside to make sure all needed information and evidences are provided to\nyou to back up your claim.The account has an open beneficiary status that\nis why I have contacted you to come forth and claim the funds as the next\nof kin and beneficiary. If we do not make claim to the funds now, the funds\nwould be reverted back to  the system as unclaimed estate at the expiration\nof a 10 year  dormancy period as approved.I assure you that this\ntransaction would be handled under due inheritance procedures and every\nnecessary legitimate arrangement will be put in place to make you the real\nbeneficiary of the inheritance funds.
