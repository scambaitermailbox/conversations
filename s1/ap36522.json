My name is Lucy Jacobs; I'm a Brit who lives in Dewsbury England. I attend university and I do part time work as a dressmaker. I lost my father in an auto accident prompting my mother\u2019s death because of it.\nMy Father, Jacobs Woolf, willed me a large portion of his real estate holdings and income properties valued at \u00a35,700,000 Pounds Sterling. I have yet to place a claim on it but right now things are not good and I'd like to have it. My Fathers stipulation was that I was either 30 years of age or married.\n(Allowing my Husband to be in control). I am 26 so only my husband can make a claim on my behalf. I\u2019d like to offer you the opportunity to stand in as my Husband and will share it for your assistance.
