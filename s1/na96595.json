I\ncontacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of\nthis communication. I invested his funds into trading in the Stock Market,\nCrude Oil and Lending with Profit Returns, as my specialty is to advise\ncustomers to invest healthily and yield good profit. Based on my advice, we\nspun the money across various opportunities and made attractive margins for\nour first months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood out\nand my client was glad about the returns.\nIn mid-2012, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to\nmake an urgent landed property investment requiring cash payments in the\nUnited Kingdom. He directed that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with\na security firm in a Private Bank. I informed him that the bank will have\nto make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to\ncircumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from\nthe funds to cater for banking and statutory charges. I contacted my\naffiliate in France and made the funds available to the GOLD PRIVATE\nCORPORATE BANK\nI undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise\ninstructions to the letter and had the funds deposited at the private bank.\nIt is a specialist private bank that accepts deposits from high net worth\nindividuals and blue-chip corporations that handle valuable products or\nundertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and\nhighly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and\nwell-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was\ndeposited with GOLD PRIVATE CORPORATE BANK France. The deceased told me he\nwanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from South Africa\nlater that week.\nThis was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the fact\nthat I managed the private banking sector. I was the only one who knew\nabout the deposit at GPCB Security Safe keeping house. I immediately passed\nthe task of allocating him to the internal investigations department of\nBristol & West. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a\nheart attack in Cannes, South of France. The bank immediately launched an\ninvestigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert them about the\nsituation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar\nwith private banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually\nprefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional\nprocesses.\nIn line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed\naway, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who\nshould have the right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the\npast months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our\nprivate investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the\nproblem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with\nyour details as a possible relative of the deceased.\nMy official capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise the\ninvestigation and the only party to receive the results of the\ninvestigation. What this means, you being the last batch of names we have\nconsidered, is that our dear late fellow died with no or identifiable\nfamily member. This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of\nwhat the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late\nbeneficiary of the deposit.GOLD PRIVATE CORPORATE BANK France will by the\nend of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to\nBristol & West, failing to receive viable claims they will probably revert\nthe deposit back to Bristol & West.\nThis will result in the money entering the Bristol & West accounting system\nand the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the GOLD PRIVATE\nCORPORATE BANK. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as\nBristol & West is concerned, the transaction with our late customer\nconcluded when I sent the funds to GOLD PRIVATE CORPORATE BANK all\noutstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services\nand due process. GOLD PRIVATE CORPORATE BANK has no single idea of the\nhistory or nature of the deposit. They are simply awaiting instructions to\nrelease the deposit to any party that comes forward.\nThis is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to\ntrack this man's family and they have investigated for months and have\nfound no family. The investigation has come to an end. My proposal to you\nis because you share similar details to the late fellow and I am prepared\nto place you in a position to instruct GOLD PRIVATE CORPORATE BANK to\nrelease the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt\nof the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half 50/50.\nGOLD PRIVATE CORPORATE BANK France and instruct them to release the deposit\nto you. GOLD PRIVATE CORPORATE BANK France directs the funds to another\nbank with you as the account holder. This way there will be no need for you\nto think of traveling to lay claim to the money from GOLD PRIVATE CORPORATE\nBANK France.\nI am aware of the consequences of this proposal. If my offer is of no\nappeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not\ndestroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You may not\nknow this but people like me who have made tidy sums out of comparable\nsituations run the whole private banking sector.\nI am a family Woman and this is an opportunity to provide them with new\nopportunities. I am the only one who knows of this situation, good fortune\nhas blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of\nrelevance in my life. I repeat I do not want you contacting me through my\nofficial phone lines nor do I want you contacting me through my official\nemail account. My official lines are not secure lines as they are\nperiodically monitored to access our level of customer care in line with\nour Total Quality Management Policy.\nThis is the one truth I have learned from my private banking years\nexperience\nRegards\nMrs Maria Patch\n", "From: b*******1@gmail.com\nTo: na96595@m**************p\nTime: 2023-02-21 16:42:45\nSUBJECT: Re: You are the next of kin of Late Dr Andrew Charles.\nHi,\nI\u2019m some worth Pleased with your prompt response, I really want you to take\na step into  this mutually beneficial transaction irrespective of the fear\nin you  to carry out this deal with me, but I assure you that this business\nis absolutely legal and risk-free and it shall follow Legal procedures in\nconfirmation that there is NO RISK involved since you bear same name with\nLate Dr. Andrew and that qualifies you as a relative without further\ninvestigation.\nI demand for your total Honesty, Faithfulness and Confidentiality regarding\nall matters in the transaction.
