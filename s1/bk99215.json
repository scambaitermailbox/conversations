It has defiled all type of medicine at the moment, I have just a few months to live according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as i don't really care for anyone not even myself but my business.\nThough I am very rich, I wasn't generous, I was always hostile to people and focus on my business as that was the thing I cared for. But I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the wealth in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that I know my time is near, I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends.\nI have decided to give alms to charity, The last of my wealth which is the huge cash deposit that I have with a financial institute abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and use it to help people in need and also open a charity institution in my memorial. I am writing this from my laptop computer in my sickbed where I wait for my time to come. I pray that God uses you to support me.\nRegards\nMr. Patrick James   \n", "From: p*************7@gmail.com\nTo: bk99215@m**************p\nTime: 2023-02-21 22:57:29\nSUBJECT: Re: Dearest,\nDear Beloved ,\nThanks for the response, I trustfully appreciated the fact that you really\nwanted to assist me in the funds distributions.
