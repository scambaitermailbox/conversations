All I need is a secure cooperation to enable this transaction. \nYou have nothing to worry about as this transaction is 100% risk free. I \nwill use my position as the attorney of the deceased to successfully \ncarry out this transaction.\nThe planned transaction will be carried out under an authorized order. \nHowever, if you wish to reach me with this goal, please contact me for \nfurther details.\nSincerely,\nKathrine Solace LLB (Hons) Vice President and CFO\nHead of Legal Department SNR.
