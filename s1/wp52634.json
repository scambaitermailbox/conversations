I earn a living in the oil industry as an\nindependent Feasibility/Project Management Consultant to oil refineries and\nother oil industries in Southern African, East Africa and some parts of\nAsia. We are based in Japan, London and Johannesburg RSA. Our mandate\nincludes identifying specific licensed crude oil export/ marketing firms\nand recommending these firms to the oil refineries for supply of crude oil\nto the refineries.\nOn my desk is a mandate from one of the refineries to arrange for crude oil\npurchase from Libya for up to 2,000,000 barrels on monthly bases for 12\ncalendar months. The essence of my reaching out to you is the fact that I\nam in the process of building a middle man structure to mediate between the\n2 parties involved before the contract is signed. You may be wondering why\nI cannot do it by myself right? The honest fact is that as a consultant to\nthese oil refineries, we are not allowed to act as suppliers of crude oil\nto them as well, hence the reason I need a trustworthy person outside my\nwork circle in order to maintain a discreet profile.\nI wish to extend this partnership to you my friend to build a middle man\nstructure with you, while I work from the back to guide you. Our\ncommission/brokerage as middle persons is between $2 - $3 per barrel as\ncase may be. So if the target of 2M barrels is met monthly we stand to\nshare $4M - $6M every month for a span of 12 months with possible\nextension.\nWorry less about the speedy sales as I have contacts within oil producing\ncountry's top officials for license of crude oil export/lifting to any firm\nI present for this business. Therefore if you can be able to handle this\ntransaction with honesty and integrity, you should come back to me\nimmediately for more details, Your urgent response is highly needed, i can\nassure you there are no risks involved here.\nRegards.\nMr. Sani Idris Ibrahim\n", "From: s****************5@gmail.com\nTo: wp52634@m**************p\nTime: 2023-03-04 15:21:20\nSUBJECT: Re: Good morning,\nDear Patricia,\nThank you for your well received message.
