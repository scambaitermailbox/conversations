I will send you the details, but I have to be very sure that you are willing to assist me. If we can agree on some terms then you will have yours and keep mine until I return, then the both of us can do this together.\nI agreed to offer you a reasonable percentage(40%) of the total sum of money as gratification for your assistance and cooperation. It's $100 bills throughout and it's contained in one Trunk box. I'm thinking of tagging the box as \"personal effects\" and shipping it out of Germany through a special diplomatic scheme through the help of a Canadian Diplomat I told you about in my previous email. Please respond ASAP because I don't like the box to continue to be here, for security purposes.\nI also advise you to please keep this issue highly confidential. Diplomatic shipment is a very secure and legal way of sending the Trunk box of money out of here (Germany) and I will discuss this with you in full details in my next email. Please do confirm to me if this is quite acceptable by you so that I can start making arrangements immediately to have the Trunk box shipped out of Germany\nYou may be wondering why I choose to trust a delicate matter like this in the care of a stranger, but this is the best I can do in my present situation. I would have trusted this kind of project in the hands of my wife who was my closest confidant, but I lost her to cancer on 22ND April 2006 7 months after we got married, and my only brother has ruined his life with hard drugs, hence my decision to work with a neutral person if we can establish some trust between ourselves instead of confiding in my buddies back home so that this little secret can be preserved. I will await your immediate response to this email . I am counting on your understanding and full cooperation in order to make this work faster. I can bet with my life that we cannot afford to fail with the arrangement already put in place for the delivery of the Trunk Box of money to you.\nI await your immediate contact with me. Let me know what you have to say about the sharing ratio and also confirm your willingness to cooperate with me in this project. When replying to this email, please send your personal information such as full names, contact address and direct telephone number and ID to me and I will send you my ID and pictures of the money when I receive your full contact information, so that we can endorse a memorandum of understanding. \nSincerely\nCapt Greg\n"], "outbound_messages": ["From: i*****9@mail.wltechinc.top\nTo: c************1@yahoo.com\nTime: 2023-03-01 17:41:59\nSUBJECT: Re:   Dear  \nDear Captain Eskim,Thank you for your email.I'm afraid that can't be doing my business in hurry as have some important business to attend to. have to bring myself to prepare for the trip to theColonies.\nBest,\nMaxine\n", "From: i*****9@mail.wltechinc.top\nTo: c************1@yahoo.com\nTime: 2023-03-01 23:41:19\nSUBJECT: Re:   Dear Urgent Response\nColch MorganSir,was pleased to hear about your proposal and, to great extent taken to mean your in good position to assist me.
