I write this letter with a heart\nfull of sadness and emotion. It requires compassion from a kind,\nloving and energetic person. As long as your heart is pure and sincere\nand my last wish comes true, I promise you will not regret this day.\nMy name is Hideto Miki. I am 64 years old and born in Nagahama City,\nShiga Prefecture. I came across your email while searching on google.\nGod and my spirit have accepted that I will contact you for help. I\nhave been suffering from breast and throat cancer for a long time.\nFrom all the signs, my condition is really getting worse. And it's\nclear that I can't work or do stressful things. According to my\ndoctor, they advised me that I might not be able to live for the next\ntwo months. So I would like to take the last opportunity to donate all\nmy assets and wealth to charity. This is because the stage of the\ncancer is getting worse. I was born and raised in a motherless baby's\nhouse, so I understand the suffering of underprivileged children in\nsociety. I have been married to my deceased husband for 36 years and\nhave no children. My husband, the late Andrew Anderson, worked for the\nUS oil company Anadarko Oil for 11 years. Before he died in a fatal\ncar accident. My husband died in 2015. After his death, I decided not\nto remarry. I sold all my real estate and deposited a total of $ 8.3\nmillion. ($ 8 million, $ 300,000). To our non-resident account. My\ndeceased husband's brother received over $ 2.8 million and ran away\nunaware that his deceased brother (my husband) left other money and\nproperty in my name. The total amount left in my name was $ 3 million.\nAfter selling all the properties, I realized $ 5.3 million and\ndeposited it in a non-residential account in Turkey. So the total\namount I have now is $ 8,300,000. I decided not to contact my deceased\nhusband's brother again. The paying bank said in a letter that it\ncould release the money to anyone I authorized. Therefore, this money\nwill be sent to his or her bank account around the world. I am\ncurrently using a laptop in a hospital in London. Here I am being\ntreated for my illness. Since then, I have lost the ability to speak\nand my doctor told me that I could only live for another two months.\nMy last wish is to donate at least 60% of this to certain charities\naffected by natural disasters such as typhoons, earthquakes and\norphanages. 40% can be used by yourself. What I expect is kindness,\nhonesty, and a healthy person who fulfills my last wish on earth.\nBefore writing to you today. I prayed to God, and my spirit gave me\nthe confidence to send this information. It's a difficult decision. As\nsoon as you agree to help me fulfill my last wish, I will give you the\ncontact information of the paying bank. There are instructions on who\nto contact and how to quickly receive funds in your personal account.\nMy lawyer will send you a power of attorney to prove that you are my\nstakeholder and the full beneficiary of this fund. All I need from you\nis an honest guarantee. That is, this money will be used for the above\npurposes when received. You are the first and last person I will\ncontact on this issue. If you are late in replying, we will contact\nanother individual or group for the same purpose. Feel free to do this\nwith me. Please. Donate 60% of this money to charity and 40% to\nyourself. But I sincerely seek your trust in this transaction. I\npropose as a free-spirited and sincere person from God. Please. Be\nsure to accept it accordingly, as described here.
