Muammar Gaddafi, former Libya Leader who died on October 20, 2011. I have the belief and understanding that my late father\u2019s death was masterminded by the international community based on the role my late Father has shown to the western world over his leadership in our country Libya . They have taken all that I suffered and saved for since his death including some of my treasure, houses and bank accounts closed by the new Government. Hence, I am contacting you to assist me in removing the sum of sixty five million USA dollars deposited with a safe deposit company in  Dubai, United Arab Emirate.\nThe funds was deposited with a deposit company in my name and as a matter of fact me, my only son and the entire family of my father in-law were trapped in a bunker here in Tripoli. I manage to sneak out with my son with the help of a security guard on duty that fateful day. I manage to crossed the border and I am presently into hiding in Oman without any other means of communication unless my laptop hoping to arrange for my traveling out possible to Europe to safeguard my life because I know that the regime of my father  has collapse after his death .Please for your kind assistance I will offer you 30% of the total sum, all the legal documentation concerning the deposit are with me, I will only write power of attorney making you the new beneficiary of the deposit so that the security company can release the consignment to you.\nBear in mind that the funds was deposited with the safe  deposit firm as a household effect, therefore they do not know the real content, so you are going to collect the consignment as house effect from the security company whereas only you and I know the real content.\nOnce you successfully collect the consignment from the deposit company you will send me with some money so that I can arrange for my traveling where we can meet ourselves for disbursement.\nMay Allah grant you the heart to assist me and my only son in this our trial period, please never abandon me with my son just because we are Arabs, but I want to assure you that I am of a clean heart that was brought up under western education but married to a cruel family.\nGet back with your details so that we can proceed without delay because l am here without help from no one. Please you should respond ONLY though my most private mail box: \nabus32006@yahoo.com\nBest regards,\nAisha  Al-Gaddafi\n", "From: a*******3@yahoo.com\nTo: oy86475@m**************p\nTime: 2022-07-27 23:57:50\nSUBJECT: Re: Details of The transaction\nDear Sir,\nThanks for your response and the content is noted. I must first of all apologize for contacting you through this medium. It is because I have no other option since I need this assistance and I have no other person to turn to but I wish to assure you that everything about this transaction is real and genuine. In fact, I got your contact through my private search for a reliable and trustworthy person to work with.\nMoreover, the legal process will be strictly adhered to. I brought this transaction to you with the real intention of investing the money instead of it being idle in the vault of a safe deposit company without yielding any interest. In fact, everything about this transaction will be successful because all modalities to ensure that it is successful have been carefully worked out. This I guarantee. All I need from you is your complete devotion towards its completion. Please be informed that I will email you all the verifiable documents as we progress in this transaction and get to know each other better.\nNevertheless, may God/Allah guide you to help me. I need a person like you as I was searching for someone who will help me as I am presently in a refugee camp between Oman and Bahrain. It is like hell being here when my son is sick. The doctor said that he has a complex congenital heart defect that needs to be repaired urgently through surgery. He said that his kind of defect is called Tetralogy of Fallot. I do not understand his explanation properly. I honestly believe that Khamis need the surgery urgently in a developed country where there are better medical facilities.\nMoreover, I need to find a good life out here and also think of a partner who I can jointly have a lucrative investment in your country as I am a bit relieved for your understanding of my predicament in my last long email. I am a woman of integrity with due respect, I promise you in the name of God/Allah in his infinite mercy who have divinely made us to meet as our creator who have made us to be honest to each other in this transaction.\nHowever, for us to proceed with this transaction, you should email me your full name, address, your age, marital status and employment status. You should also include your phone number. It is this information that I will use to start up with all the necessary documentation that will make you the legal beneficiary of the said money. In fact, I will use it to prepare a power of attorney. The Power of Attorney from me will be a legal document authorizing the deposit company to release that said deposit to you, It will also give you the legal entitlement of the deposit and will show or prove to the deposit company that I gave you the power to collect the deposit being its proxy beneficiary on my behalf as per the instruction earlier given company when it was deposited.\nAn affidavit will be sworn at the High court to that effect and it will also enable the deposit company to legally change the name of the beneficiary to yours and a new certificate of deposit will be re-issued in your name. I will draft an agreement between me and you in order to protect our interest and also to state that the money in your TRUST is for investment purposes and also it is from a genuine source. This will help prevent any future misunderstanding between us.\nYou should be rest assured that everything will be handled professionally and efficiently by the deposit since this is not the first time they are doing this kind of deal. In fact, they are reputed to help many diplomats and top government officials who are involved in confidential business transactions. You should always endeavour to maintain the confidentiality of the transaction. This is very important for its success.\nYou should keep everything about our communication secret because you are one of the very few people on earth that I am communicating with or even know my location. I am looking forward to establishing a long lasting business and personal relationship with you. I have attached my photo for your perusal so that you can know who you are dealing with.\nYour earliest response to this mail will be highly appreciated.\nBest regards,\nAisha\n"], "outbound_messages": ["From: oy86475@m**************p\nTo: a*******3@yahoo.com\nTime: 2022-07-27 21:34:45\nSUBJECT: Re: Good Day,\nI think I can do something to help you.
